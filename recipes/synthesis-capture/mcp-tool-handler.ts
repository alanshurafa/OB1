/**
 * capture_synthesis — MCP tool handler for Open Brain
 *
 * Paste this inside your open-brain-mcp Edge Function's server setup, next to
 * the existing `capture_thought` registerTool call (see OB1's server/index.ts).
 *
 * What it does
 * ------------
 * Lets an AI client save its own synthesis of multiple source thoughts as a
 * NEW thought, with `derived_from` pointing back to every source ID. The
 * "Query-as-Ingest" pattern: once a complex question has been answered by
 * combining atomic thoughts, the answer becomes reusable knowledge instead of
 * something the model has to re-derive every time.
 *
 * Requirements
 * ------------
 * This handler writes to three provenance columns on `public.thoughts`:
 *   - derivation_layer  (text: 'primary' | 'derived')
 *   - derivation_method (text: 'synthesis')
 *   - derived_from      (jsonb: array of parent thought IDs)
 *
 * Those columns are added by the `provenance-chains` recipe's schema
 * migration. This recipe will NOT work without that migration applied.
 *
 * Safety rules enforced here
 * --------------------------
 *  1. At least 3 source thought IDs required (Zod `.min(3)`).
 *  2. All source IDs must resolve to existing rows in `public.thoughts`.
 *  3. At least one source must have `derivation_layer = 'primary'` — forbids
 *     pure synthesis-of-synthesis chains that would compound noise.
 *  4. Rejects sources that are themselves `source_type = 'synthesis'` so the
 *     system cannot loop on its own derived output.
 *
 * Assumes in scope
 * ----------------
 *   - `server`    : your McpServer instance (from @modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
 *   - `supabase`  : your Supabase service-role client
 *   - `z`         : zod
 *   - `getEmbedding(text)`   : your existing embedding helper (OB1 default)
 *   - `extractMetadata(text)`: your existing metadata helper (OB1 default)
 *
 * If your `open-brain-mcp` already wraps these differently, adapt the two
 * helper calls below — the rest of the logic is independent.
