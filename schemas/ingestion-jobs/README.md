# Ingestion Jobs

> Track dry-run import jobs, extracted items, review status, and execution counts.

## What It Does

This schema adds `public.ingestion_jobs` and `public.ingestion_items` for import workflows that need a reviewable dry run before writing new thoughts. It also adds helper RPCs for recounting job results and appending concise evidence to existing thoughts.

The schema stores extracted thought candidates and source metadata, not full raw transcripts. Items default to `review_status = 'unreviewed'` so inferred or generated memory remains evidence-grade until reviewed.

## Prerequisites

- Working Open Brain setup ([guide](../../docs/01-getting-started.md))
- Supabase project with SQL Editor access
- Existing `public.thoughts` table
- Service-role access for backend import workers

## Credential Tracker

```text
INGESTION JOBS -- CREDENTIAL TRACKER
--------------------------------------

FROM YOUR OPEN BRAIN SETUP
  Supabase Project URL:      ____________
  Supabase Service Role Key: ____________

SETUP
  SQL migration applied:     yes / no
  Test job cleaned up:       yes / no

--------------------------------------
```

## Steps

1. Open your Supabase project.

2. Go to SQL Editor and create a new query.

3. Copy and run [`schema.sql`](./schema.sql).

4. Verify the tables exist:

   ```sql
   select table_name
   from information_schema.tables
   where table_schema = 'public'
     and table_name in ('ingestion_jobs', 'ingestion_items');
   ```

5. Verify the helper functions exist:

   ```sql
   select routine_name
   from information_schema.routines
   where routine_schema = 'public'
     and routine_name in ('recount_ingestion_job', 'append_thought_evidence');
   ```

6. Create a dry-run test job:

   ```sql
   insert into public.ingestion_jobs (
     source_type,
     source_label,
     input_hash,
     input_bytes,
     dry_run,
     status
   )
   values (
     'manual-test',
     'Manual schema test',
     'sha256:test-ingestion-job',
     42,
     true,
     'pending'
   )
   returning id;
   ```

7. Add one reviewable item using the returned job ID:

   ```sql
   insert into public.ingestion_items (
     job_id,
     sequence,
     extracted_content,
     content_fingerprint,
     action,
     status,
     reason,
     review_status
   )
   values (
     '<job-id>',
     1,
     'Use dry-run import review before writing migrated records.',
     'sha256:test-item',
     'add',
     'ready',
     'manual_schema_test',
     'unreviewed'
   );
   ```

8. Clean up the test job:

   ```sql
   delete from public.ingestion_jobs
   where input_hash = 'sha256:test-ingestion-job';
   ```

## Expected Outcome

After setup, your database has:

- `public.ingestion_jobs`
- `public.ingestion_items`
- `public.recount_ingestion_job(uuid)`
- `public.append_thought_evidence(uuid, jsonb)`
- RLS enabled on both tables
- Service-role grants for backend import workers

The normal lifecycle is:

```text
pending -> converting -> validating -> extracting -> reconciling
        -> dry_run_complete -> approved -> executing -> complete
```

Failed or cancelled jobs use `failed` or `cancelled`.

## Lifecycle Notes

`ingestion_jobs.dry_run` defaults to `true`. A backend can create jobs and items, reconcile each item to an action, then stop at `dry_run_complete` for human review. Execution happens later after approved items are marked ready.

`ingestion_items.action` describes what should happen:

| Action | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `add` | Create a new thought. |
| `skip` | Do not write because the item is duplicate or low value. |
| `append_evidence` | Add concise evidence to an existing thought. |
| `create_revision` | Create a revised thought derived from an existing one. |

`review_status` is separate from execution status. New items are `unreviewed` by default.

## What This Does Not Do

- It does not import records by itself.
- It does not generate embeddings.
- It does not call an LLM.
- It does not expose an Edge Function.
- It does not include dashboard screens.

Those behaviors belong to later ingestion PRs.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: `relation "public.thoughts" does not exist`**
Solution: Complete the Open Brain setup first. The helper evidence RPC expects the core `thoughts` table.

**Issue: duplicate input hash**
Solution: The same source hash already has a job. Query `public.ingestion_jobs` by `source_type` and `input_hash` to inspect the existing dry run.

**Issue: evidence excerpt is too long**
Solution: Store a concise excerpt. Do not append raw transcripts or large source documents as evidence.
