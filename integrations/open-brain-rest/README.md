# Open Brain REST Gateway

`open-brain-rest` is the Supabase Edge Function used by the Next.js dashboard for the non-Agent-Memory OB1 surfaces:

- Dashboard stats and recent thoughts
- Thoughts browse/detail/edit/delete
- Search
- Workflow kanban updates
- Duplicate review
- Audit review
- Add to Brain

Agent Memory stays in `integrations/agent-memory-api`. This gateway only handles the base `thoughts` operational surface.

## Required Secrets

Set these as Supabase function secrets:

| Secret | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` | Dashboard/API access key, sent as `x-brain-key` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Embeddings and metadata extraction |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Provided automatically by Supabase |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Provided automatically by Supabase |

## Required Database Shape

Apply the base OB1 schema plus:

- `schemas/enhanced-thoughts/schema.sql`
- `schemas/workflow-status/migration.sql`

The function expects `thoughts.id` to be a UUID. The dashboard now treats thought IDs as strings end to end.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/health` | GET | Auth/API health check |
| `/stats` | GET | Aggregate count, type, and topic stats |
| `/thoughts` | GET | Paginated thought browse with filters |
| `/thought/:id` | GET/PUT/DELETE | Detail, edit, delete |
| `/capture` | POST | Save one thought |
| `/search` | POST | Semantic or text search |
| `/duplicates` | GET | Near-duplicate scan |
| `/thought/:id/connections` | GET | Metadata-overlap connections |
| `/thought/:id/reflection` | GET/POST | Reflection reads/writes when the optional table exists |
| `/ingestion-jobs` | GET | Smart-ingest placeholder for dashboard compatibility |
| `/ingest` | POST | Current v1 fallback captures input as one thought |

### CRM (optional)

These require the `crm-core` (and, for engagement, `crm-engagement`) schemas. On a brain without them the routes return the underlying "function does not exist" error, and the dashboard hides the section via feature detection (`GET /crm/contacts?limit=1`).

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/crm/contacts` | GET/POST | List (search/tier/lifecycle) and create contacts |
| `/crm/contacts/:id` | GET/PATCH | Detail (record + methods + aliases) and guarded field write |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/methods` | POST | Add/update a contact method |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/field-evidence` | GET/POST | Read/attach supporting or contradicting thoughts |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/field-lock` | POST | Freeze/unfreeze a single field |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/history` | GET | Change-log for the contact |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/relationship-items` | GET | Notes + tasks + important-dates bundle |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/notes`, `/crm/notes/:noteId` | POST, PATCH | Note create / edit |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/tasks`, `/crm/tasks/:taskId` | POST, PATCH | Task create / edit |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/important-dates`, `/crm/important-dates/:dateId` | POST, PATCH | Important-date create / edit |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/interactions`, `/crm/interactions`, `/crm/interactions/:id` | GET, POST, PATCH | Interaction log |
| `/crm/contacts/:id/timeline` | GET | Change-log + interactions + evidence, newest first |
| `/crm/proposals`, `/crm/proposals/count` | GET | Proposal inbox + open-count nav badge |
| `/crm/proposals/:id/resolve`, `/crm/proposals/resolve-run` | POST | Accept/reject one proposal, or a whole import run |

Accepting a contact edit or adding a method keeps the contact's searchable **card thought** (`crm_contacts.card_thought_id`) in sync. Write-back reuses the gateway's existing embedding path and is best-effort: it never fails the write, and degrades to a text-searchable card when no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set.

### Wiki (optional)

These require the `wiki-pages` schema. On a brain without it the routes return a clean `404`: the gateway maps PostgREST's schema-cache errors (`PGRST205` "Could not find the table" from the direct-table list query, `PGRST202` "Could not find the function" from the RPC-backed routes) as well as raw Postgres `42P01`/`42883` "does not exist" errors to 404. The dashboard hides the section via feature detection (`GET /wiki/pages?per_page=1`).

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/wiki/pages` | GET | List active pages (optional `page_kind` filter), each with a `section_count` |
| `/wiki/pages` | POST | Create/update a page by slug (`wiki_upsert_page`) |
| `/wiki/pages/:slug` | GET | Fetch one page plus its non-deleted sections, ordered like the wiki-mcp tools |
| `/wiki/pages/:slug/sections/:sectionKey` | PUT | Write a section as a manual (human) edit, through the regen guard (`wiki_write_section`) |
| `/wiki/sections/:id/accept-pending` | POST | Promote a parked machine draft to the live body (`wiki_accept_pending`) |
| `/wiki/sections/:id/reject-pending` | POST | Discard a parked machine draft without applying it (`wiki_reject_pending`) |
| `/wiki/sections/:id/lock` | POST | Freeze/unfreeze a section against machine overwrites |
| `/wiki/pages/:slug` | DELETE | Archive a page (`status='archived'`) — never a hard delete |

`GET /wiki/pages` only lists `status='active'` pages, matching `wiki_list_pages`. `GET /wiki/pages/:slug` fetches by slug with no status filter (same as `wiki_get_page` in `integrations/wiki-mcp`), so an archived page stays individually reachable by slug — and its sections stay editable via the `PUT` route, which also skips the status filter — even though it drops out of the list. Section writes from this REST surface always use `p_origin='manual'` — a human editing through the dashboard takes ownership of the section, same as an in-app manual edit; automated/generator writes still go through `wiki-mcp`'s `wiki_write_section` tool with `p_origin='generated'` and are subject to the regen guard.

## Deploy

From a Supabase workdir, copy or symlink this folder to `supabase/functions/open-brain-rest`, then deploy:

```bash
supabase functions deploy open-brain-rest --no-verify-jwt --use-api --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

The dashboard should point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` at:

```text
https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-rest
```

## Smoke Test

Run the live smoke harness against a deployed function:

```bash
OB1_REST_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-rest" \
OB1_REST_KEY="YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY" \
node integrations/open-brain-rest/smoke/live-smoke.mjs
```

The smoke creates three temporary rows, verifies health, capture, browse, stats, text search, workflow update, duplicate scan, and audit filtering, then deletes the rows. Pass `--keep` only when you intentionally want to inspect the created rows.

The CRM surface has its own harness (needs the `crm-core` / `crm-engagement` schemas):

```bash
OB1_REST_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-rest" \
OB1_REST_KEY="YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY" \
node integrations/open-brain-rest/smoke/crm-smoke.mjs
```

It creates one contact, exercises detail, list, patch, methods, notes, tasks, dates, interactions, history, timeline, field lock, and the proposal count, then archives the contact and deletes its card thought.

The wiki surface has its own harness (needs the `wiki-pages` schema):

```bash
OB1_REST_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-rest" \
OB1_REST_KEY="YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY" \
node integrations/open-brain-rest/smoke/wiki-smoke.mjs
```

It creates one page, exercises list (with `section_count`), get-by-slug, a two-write section edit (created then updated), lock/unlock, and a reject-pending negative check (no pending draft to reject), then archives the page.

## Dashboard Demo Seed

To seed the same data story used by the screenshot/PDF/video walkthrough:

```bash
OB1_REST_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-rest" \
OB1_REST_KEY="YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY" \
node integrations/open-brain-rest/smoke/seed-dashboard-demo.mjs --apply
```

Run without `--apply` first for a dry run. The seed writes through `/capture`, so it exercises the real dashboard gateway and embedding path.

## Notes

- Duplicate review uses a local token-similarity scan in v1. It is intentionally simple and cheap for solo/small-team OB1 deployments.
- Semantic search and capture require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- Reflection and smart-ingest routes are compatibility surfaces. If the optional tables/workers are missing, the dashboard still works for the core thoughts/workflow/search/audit surfaces.
